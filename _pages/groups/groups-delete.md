Only a group manager or a user with administrator role can delete a group.
A Group cannot be deleted as long as it is the **sole owner** of a shared resource.
A Group can be deleted subject to relevant permissions by sending a `DELETE` request to `/groups/<groupId>.json`

```
DELETE /groups/<groupId>.json
```

A dry run can also be performed before actually attempting to delete a group. 
This works as follow:
```
DELETE /groups/<groupId>/dry-run.json
```

This will check all the constraints and return a 200 OK response if the group can be deleted safely.
