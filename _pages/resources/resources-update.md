A Resource can be updated by sending a `PUT` request to `/resources/<resourceId>.json`:
The request body contains the new data to be updated. The request body schema is same than when creating a resource.

```
PUT /resources/<resourceId>.json
```
```json
{
  "name": "<string>",
  "description": "<string>",
  "secrets": [{
    "user_id": "<userId-1>",
    "data": "<encrypted_password_using_user_1_public_key>"
  }, {
    "user_id": "<userId-n>",
    "data": "<encrypted_password_using_user_n_public_key>"
  }]
}
```

If the password you are updating has been shared with 7 users, the “secrets” key will need to be an array of 7 objects:
You must encrypt and sign the new plaintext passwords using the recipient public key and the current user secret key.
You can then create a list which include one object per user: the `data` key holds the encrypted plaintext password 
and `user_id` holds the user UUID.
