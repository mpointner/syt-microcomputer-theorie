## Examples
### Filtered request

It is possible to adjust the request response for example to
*   include `creator`, `favorite`, `modifier`, `permission` and `tag`
*   Sort DESC by resource modification datetime
*   Filter by `is-favorite`, `is-shared-with-group`, `is-owned-by-me`, `is-shared-with-me` and `has-id`

Such a request will look like this:

```
GET /resources.json?contain[creator]=1
        &contain[favorite]=1
        &contain[modifier]=1
        &contain[permission]=1
        &contain[tag]=1
        &order[]=Resource.modified DESC
```

### Success response
A successful response will have an array of json objects with each representing a single resource. It will look something like this example:

{% include api/json/resources/resources-index-success-contain.md %}
