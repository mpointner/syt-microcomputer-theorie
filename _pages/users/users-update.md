## Update a User

A User can be updated by sending the `PUT` request to `/users/<userId>.json`.
```
PUT /users/<userId>.json
```

The request body contains the new data to be updated. The request body schema is same as that 
of creating a new User with the exception of the email/username field which can not be updated.

A user can update themselves. Then can change their first name and last name but not their role.
An administrator can update their role. No one can update the username. If a user need to change
their username, one will need to create a new user for this given email.
