<table class="table-parameters">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Param</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Required</th>
    <th>Type</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>filter</td>
   <td>Filters the result based on child params</td>
   <td>No</td>
   <td>Array</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>filter[modified-after]</td>
   <td>Will only include keys modified after the given date</td>
   <td>No</td>
   <td>Unix Timestamp</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>filter[is-deleted]</td>
